WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net sp1/playerCtrl_00/c_clk_reg[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin sp1/playerCtrl_00/tone2_reg[15]_i_2/O, cell sp1/playerCtrl_00/tone2_reg[15]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
